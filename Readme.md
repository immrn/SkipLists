# Skip List Library
Simple implementation of skip lists
(for more information have a look at skiplist.h)

## Example and Benchmarks
    To run the example application:
        create bin folder:	$ mkdir bin 
        build:      		$ make
	    execute:    		$ ./bin/skiplist

    To use the benchmarks go into main.c and change the called function Example() to Benchmark01(), Benchmark02() or Benchmark03().

    Cleaning:
        clean:      $ make clean
